EasyCTF 2018

Hidden Key (250) - Math oreinted RSA problem, where given modulus, exponent, and ciphertext and 2*d+phi. Use the definition:
ed == 1 mod phi(n) to substitute phi in there. Get a modular equation for d, then bruteforce with bounds what d is.

RSA_v (200) - Use mod properties to multiply all the exponents to one, and since the exponent is so large wiener's attack works.

Not OTP (100) - cribdrag with known easyctf{

Return of RSA (400) - very recent exploit, the modulus given is vulnerable with the ROCA attack and
